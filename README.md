# BlackdotTask

Exercise in which it was required to make an application to input a search term and display a list of combined search results from two different 
search engines, without using any of their APIs.

For this case, I used Google Search and Search Encrypt engines and .Net Core MVC framework with the HtmlAgilityPack package to parse the websites 
and get the list of results.

To install HtmlAgilityPack you have to run the command "Install-Package HtmlAgilityPack -Version 1.11.42" in the Package Manager.
